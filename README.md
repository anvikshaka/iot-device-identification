# IoT RF Device Classification

This project classifies recorded RF signals from six IoT device/protocol
classes with a spectrogram-based convolutional neural network (CNN):
`dooralarm`, `lora`, `microphone`, `mbus`, `sigfox`, and `miwi`.

The implemented pipeline converts one-dimensional `.npy` signals into
normalized `257 x 61 x 1` spectrogram inputs, trains a six-class CNN, and
supports both window-level evaluation and whole-file inference using averaged
sliding-window probabilities.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | Training, preprocessing, CNN definition, inference, and evaluation code |
| `data/recordings/` | Recommended multi-capture signals organized by device/scenario |
| `data/recordings_manifest.example.csv` | Template for recording-level train/validation/test assignment |
| `data/raw/`, `data/test/` | Supported legacy one-file-per-class layout |
| `models/` | Saved model binaries when present, metadata, training plots, and held-out report |
| `results/evaluation/` | Window-level evaluation reports |
| `results/test/` | File-level external test reports and probabilities |
| `docs/` | Project documentation and generated architecture diagrams |
| `tests/` | Unit tests; see the documented review findings before relying on them |

Large `.npy` signal files and `.h5`/`.keras` model binaries are excluded from
Git by `.gitignore`.

## Setup

Create an environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Multi-Recording Dataset

For multiple environments or captures of the same device, use a manifest.
Each row represents one independent recording and assigns the entire recording
to one split:

```csv
path,class,scenario,capture_id,split
data/recordings/microphone/room_capture01.npy,microphone,room,01,train
data/recordings/microphone/background_capture01.npy,microphone,background,01,validation
data/recordings/microphone/upstairs_capture01.npy,microphone,upstairs,01,test
```

Start from `data/recordings_manifest.example.csv` and add every independent
recording. `train` and `validation` must contain every class being trained. A
`test` split may contain all classes or a focused held-out scenario such as
only `microphone` upstairs recordings. Paths are interpreted from the project
working directory. A signal file path may appear only once in the manifest.

## Commands

Train using recording-level splits from a scenario/capture manifest:

```bash
python src/train.py \
  --manifest data/recordings_manifest.csv \
  --output-dir models \
  --max-windows-per-class 500
```

This prevents windows from the same capture appearing in both training and
testing. It saves model files, metadata, curves, and held-out reports in the
chosen output directory. For many long recordings,
`--max-windows-per-class` bounds spectrogram memory and samples across all
captures of a class before conversion.

Run file-level testing of held-out recordings with per-scenario metrics:

```bash
python src/test.py \
  --manifest data/recordings_manifest.csv \
  --manifest-split test \
  --model models/best_iot_classifier.h5 \
  --metadata models/metadata.json \
  --output-dir results
```

Evaluate held-out windows when a window-level diagnostic is needed:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py \
  --manifest data/recordings_manifest.csv \
  --manifest-split test \
  --evaluation-role external-window-evaluation \
  --model models/best_iot_classifier.h5 \
  --metadata models/metadata.json
```

The original one-file-per-class workflow remains supported:

```bash
python src/train.py --data-dir data/raw
python src/test.py --data-dir data/test
```

Classify one raw signal file:

```bash
python src/predict.py --input data/test/miwi_test.npy
```

Create sample spectrogram visualizations:

```bash
python src/visualize.py
```

Regenerate the documentation diagrams:

```bash
python docs/generate_diagrams.py
```

## Recorded Outputs

The checked-in metadata reports `0.9454` test accuracy for the random held-out
window split created during training. `results/evaluation/` reports `0.9900`
accuracy on `data/raw`, which is the same source directory used to build the
training set and should not be presented as independent generalization.
`results/test/` reports six correct external file predictions, one file per
class, using ensemble inference; its metrics include a file-level 95% Wilson
confidence interval to expose the small sample size.

Code review findings and their implemented remediations are tracked in
[docs/code_review.md](docs/code_review.md).
